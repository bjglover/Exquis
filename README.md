Here's a few simple Python programs to control lights on the Exquis. 

Install Python from here:
https://www.python.org/downloads/

Open a command prompt and enter "pip install python-rtmidi"
   
Download files from here (you can click on the "raw" button)

Navigate to the relevant folder in the command window and run eg "py blank.py".

This turns all lights off. Other scripts turn all lights green and animated rows and columns.

If this doesn't work, try running "py listports.py" to find the name of the device for your Exquis and edit the script in Notepad to change it from "Exquis 1" to whatever the value is. (Eg perhaps "Exquis 2".)

(Disclaimer: I only dabble in programming/github.)
